                        League of Legends is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization. League of Legends received generally positive reviews; critics highlighted its accessibility, character designs, and production value.

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. As of April 2021, there are 155 champions available to play. Over the course of a match, champions gain levels by accruing experience points (XP) through killing enemies. Items also increase the strength of champions, and are bought using gold, which players accrue passively over time and earn actively by defeating the opposing team's minions, champions, or defensive structures. In the main game mode, Summoner's Rift, items are purchased through a shop menu that is only available to players when their champion is in the team's base. Each match is discrete; levels and items do not transfer from one match to another. The game also has a ranked competitive ladder; a matchmaking system determines a player's skill level and generates a starting rank from which they can climb.

                <p>
                    League of Legends is one of the world's largest esports, described by The New York Times as its "main attraction". Online viewership and in-person attendance for the game's esports events outperformed those of the National Basketball Association, the World Series, and the Stanley Cup in 2016. For the 2019 and 2020 League of Legends World Championship finals, Riot Games reported 44 and 45 peak million concurrent viewers respectively. As of April 2021, Riot Games operates 12 regional leagues internationally, four of which – China, Europe, Korea, and North America – have franchised systems. League games are typically livestreamed on platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. The game's highest-paid professional players have commanded salaries of above $1 million.

                    <p>
                        Battlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match. Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time. At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance.

                    During the August 2017 Gamescom event, Bluehole and ESL organized the first Battlegrounds invitational tournament, with a $350,000 prize pool. Separate events were held for solo players, two-player teams, two-player teams fixed to first-person perspective, and four-player squads. Each event featured three matches, with the player or team scoring the highest across all three named winners. Later that November, a 20-team, 80-player tournament with a US$200,000 prize pool was organized by Intel in Oakland. Since then, more events have been held internationally each year to celebrate the game's anniversary.

                        Hearthstone is a free-to-play online digital collectible card game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment. Hearthstone builds upon the existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics. The game has been favorably reviewed by critics largely due to its insightful replication of the feel of a physical card game within the game's user interface.

                    <p>
                        Set within the Warcraft universe, Hearthstone is a digital-only, turn-based collectible card game which pits two opponents against each other. Players select a hero from one of ten classes. All classes have unique cards and abilities, known as hero powers, which help define class archetypes. Each player uses a deck of cards from their collection with the end goal being to reduce the opponent's health to zero. There are four different types of cards: minions, spells, weapons, and hero cards. These cards are ordered by rarity, with Legendary cards being the rarest, followed by Epic, Rare, Common, and Basic. Blizzard releases expansions of additional cards every four months to increase the variety in the metagame. The game uses a freemium model of revenue, meaning players can play for free or pay to acquire additional card packs or content.

                    Thanks to the designers' focus on accessibility and fast-paced gameplay, Hearthstone has been the focus of a number of Blizzard tournaments. In April 2014, Blizzard announced the first Hearthstone World Championship would be held at BlizzCon on November 7–8. The tournament featured players from each of the game's four regions, with each region holding its own regional qualifying tournament. The Americas and Europe regions' qualifiers featured 160 players each. Hearthstone World Championship continues to hold annually to this date. Besides, Heartstone has also been a part of a number of esport demonstration events at international competitions, such as the 2017 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games and 2018 Asian Games.
